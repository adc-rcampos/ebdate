# EBDATE #

Simple wrapper around DateTime.

## Requirements ##

* PHP >= 5.4

## Installation ##

The recommended way to install is through composer.

Just create a `composer.json` file for your project:

``` json
{
    "require": {
        "ebidtech/ebdate": "@stable"
    }
}
```

**Tip:** browse [`ebidtech/ebdate`](https://packagist.org/packages/ebidtech/ebdate) page to choose a stable version to use, avoid the `@stable` meta constraint.

And run these two commands to install it:

```bash
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ composer install
```

Now you can add the autoloader, and you will have access to the library:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
